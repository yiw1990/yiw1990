My name is Yiyuan Wu and I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses.The combination of medicine and mathematics makes perfect career for me. Currently I investigate questions related to mental health through my work as a Research Biostatistician II at [Weill Cornell Medicine](http://hpr.weill.cornell.edu/divisions/hpe/) in the department of Health Policy & Research 

I graduated from the [Rutgers University](https://stat.rutgers.edu/) with a MS in biostatistics in 2015. I started working in the department of critical care medicine as the only statistician where I help researchers with their various research projects in the area of emergency medicine. 

I am an R enthusiast and very experienced with SAS, I am also an active member of [R Ladies NYC](http://www.rladiesnyc.org/).
