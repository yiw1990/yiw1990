My name is Yiyuan Wu and I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses.The combination of medicine and mathematics makes perfect career for me. 

I graduated from the [Rutgers University](https://stat.rutgers.edu/) with a MS in biostatistics in 2015. I started working as a Biostatistician in the department of critical care medicine at Montefiore Medical Center where I help researchers with their various research projects in the area of emergency medicine.

Currently I investigate questions related to mental health through my work as a Research Biostatistician II at [Weill Cornell Medicine](http://hpr.weill.cornell.edu/divisions/hpe/) in the department of Health Policy & Research. My work involves providing consultation services for investigators with their long-term and short-term projects. That includes helping with study design, data cleaning/wrangling and data visualization, data analysis, preparation of manuscripts and many more. I am in collaboration in developing novel methods in the field of mental health mainly focus on psychotic depression in geriatric population. I am also working with projects in various other fields such as Pediatrics, Specialty Surgery, readmission and digital phenotyping using claim data etc.

Most of my research work are conducted in R and sometimes SAS. I am an R enthusiast and very experienced with SAS, I am also an active member of [R Ladies NYC](http://www.rladiesnyc.org/). My research interest include deep learning, casual mediation analysis. I am attending Causal Mediation Analysis boot camp at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/research/) in July, 2019.
